To win the game you have to collect three hints.  
Each hint has a two-digit number, when you reach the exit it would ask you to enter 
a six-digit code to win the game, but you have to enter the numbers from the hint in 
the right sequence or you will lose.  There are four hints in total and one of the 
hints is a fake number.

However, each item does not appear in the same room at the beginning of the game, 
you have to look for each item in each room.  Also, there is a flashlight, one 
dead battery, and one good battery.  You have to find the flashlight and good 
battery to look in the hidden closet because it is dark.

The right sequence to enter each number from the hints is hint1, hint2, hint3.  
If you enter the numbers in this order you will win the game.
